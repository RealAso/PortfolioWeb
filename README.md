After completing this project, I feel much more comfortable with the structure of web development, and how a website's skeleton is constructed. There is a lot that I wanted to add to this while making it, but I figured that I should atleast complete
original project before going on a rabbit hole of feature creep. This website is also self-hosted on a raspberry pi which introduced me to Nginx and Apache. Knowing how I structured the classes and ids in this very simple website (very messy), I have an idea
of how I would structure it differently next time.
